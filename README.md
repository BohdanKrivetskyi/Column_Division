# Integer-devision

Write an integer-division application that divides numbers 
and prints results into the console. Use maven, and don't 
forget to cover your code with unit tests.

Hints:
- Use common terms for variables/fields;
- Exceptions in Java (favor unchecked exceptions over checked, etc.);
- SOLID.

To assemble the project, enter:
    - mvn package clean
    - mvn -jar target/integer-devision.jar
